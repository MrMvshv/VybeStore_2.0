        VybeStore_2.0

        A web application that allows users to create and share custom playlists of songs and stream live performances of artists, producers, DJs etc.
        
        ## Team
        Irungu Macharia Josphat - MrMvshv on GitHub : Primary developer and founder
        
        ## Technologies
        ### Languages:
        Python
        JavaScript
        HTML, CSS and JavaScript
        #### Front-end:
        HTML, CSS and JavaScript
        React
        #### Back-end:
        Node.js or Django
        Various streaming servicesâ€™ API e.g Spotify
        OAuth2 for authentication
        WebSockets or WebRTC for livestreaming
        
        
        ### Node.js vs Django:
        Django is preferred because of its speed and efficiency and friendly learning curve, however as the app may need advanced customization, node.js may be more appropriate for use.
        
        ### WebSockets or WebRTC:
        Since the primary application is to stream audio and possibly video, webRTC is preferred since it is designed specifically for similar purposes. WebSockets may be implemented for use in live chatting and similar features.
        
        ## Challenge
        The goal of this project is to build a web application that allows users to create and share custom playlists of songs and stream live performances.
        The application will be developed using modern web technologies and will leverage popular music streaming services to access and play songs within the platform.
        The application will provide user authentication and authorization, as well as social features such as liking and commenting on playlists and following other users.
        
        The project is not in itself a music streaming platform, but leverages popular platforms to enable users to quickly find music related to their interests.
        
        Targeted users are all music enthusiasts and practitioners in all levels of the spectrum.
        
        This project is relevant to music lovers of all demographics and locales.
        
        ## Risks:
        ### Technical Risks and Safeguards:
        
        Integration with the Music Streaming Service API: There is a risk of the music streaming service's API being changed or updated, which could cause issues with the application's functionality. To mitigate this risk, the development team can continuously monitor the API and make necessary updates to the application's code to maintain compatibility.
        
        Live Streaming Stability: The live streaming feature is dependent on real-time communication technologies, which can be unpredictable and unstable. The development team can mitigate this risk by testing the live streaming feature extensively and implementing measures to ensure stability, such as redundancy and failover mechanisms.
        
        Security Risks: User authentication and authorization and sensitive user data such as login credentials are essential components of the application. To mitigate the risk of security breaches, the development team can implement industry-standard security measures, such as encrypting sensitive data, using secure communication protocols, and regularly updating and patching the application.
        
        ### Non-Technical Risks and Strategies:
        
        Intellectual Property Rights: There is a risk of violating intellectual property rights when using music from the streaming service. The development team can mitigate this risk by obtaining the necessary licenses and permissions from the music streaming service and adhering to their terms and conditions.
        
        Legal Liability: The application could potentially be held liable for copyright infringement or other legal issues arising from user-generated content. To mitigate this risk, the development team can implement measures such as user content moderation and implementing clear guidelines and terms of service for users.
        
        Reputation Risks: Negative user experiences or negative publicity could harm the application's reputation. To mitigate this risk, the development team can implement measures to ensure a high-quality user experience, such as user testing and feedback mechanisms, and implementing measures to address user complaints or issues. Additionally, the team can actively monitor social media and other channels for negative feedback and respond promptly to any issues that arise.
        
        ## Infrastructure:
        In the beginning, the technical team consists of one person: me. However, any new unverified updates will be done in a new branch which will be merged with master using pull requests done by volunteer collaborators.
        Data will be obtained from a small dataset of songs from the various platforms.
        
        ## Existing Solutions:
        
        The existing music sharing platforms such as spotify offer some of the above functionality such as personalized playlist creation based on user preferences. The proposed project differs from the existing solutions in that the functionality is highly human-generated and curated, thus has the potential to be more accurate than existing AI solutions out there.
        
        The platform also aims to consolidate all the best features of the above platforms into one point of access, while leveraging the tried and tested technologies applied by the above platforms.
